# rmf_legacy_adapter_utils
This is a temporary repo for bridging legacy Traffic Light API Fleets to the current RMF

## Background
To support existing implementers still running legacy Traffic Light API Fleet Adapters, this repository will provide the required functions to enable the fleets to continue interacting with RMF. However, these adapters will now be considered low compliance as they will be running as the current read-only fleets.
